Ideally, have an API that pulls from TD or from Mint to get my spending and input. Otherwise I'd have to input it myself.

All bank accounts are separate ACCOUNTS

An ACCOUNT is made up of one or more BUCKETS. There is a default (general) bucket that all other buckets in that account are carved out of.

ACCOUNTS will also store a list of TRANSACTIONS, including income. Transactions are debits that are relevant to a specific bucket. If I can't pull all my transactions from Mint then I'm not going to be able to keep track of the general bucket...

Buckets can only be a part of one ACCOUNT. They include information about their goal (general bucket doesn't have a goal), their current amount, their goal and start dates.


Not sure how I want to run this. Local deamon possibly, but prefered if I can run it as needed. 

Storage will have to be encrypted. It'll store the state of all the accounts locally, encrypted. Need to look into what I need to account for.

First thing to do is build a mint scraper based on mintapi for python.
